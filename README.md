## Motivation
After taking ESE 205, _Introduction to Engineering Design_ course at Washington University in St. Louis, and then becoming an _Assistant Instructor_ for the course and needing to repair the commetial alternative. The brand will not be stated but the vehicles were extremely time consuming to to construct and more importantly to maintain in a class setting. The servos were continously getting stripped and needing continous replacement. The was due to the weight of the items being supported, the nature of first year students, and the design being made of laser cut polycarbonate. This meant that the full car is held together with a lot of screws and hardware than what is trully necessary. 

## Goal
The goal was to design a simple and complete design for use in an introductory level hardware interfacing class. The goal of the class was to use onboard sensors to complete specified tasks as set by the intructor of the course. The chassis was to be design to be easy to assemble, easy to print, and, most importatly, easy to maintain. The aim was to make the servos easily replacable while stabalizing the head and removing steering slop, which were both problems on the original design.
